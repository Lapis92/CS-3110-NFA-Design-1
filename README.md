1. which problem(s) gave you the most trouble? Did you avoid any problem that is too challenging to finish by deadline? Did you ask questions to AI/instructor?
  A: Of the problems that I chose, the one that gave me the most trouble was problem #16. This is mainly because I was not sure whether "every odd position" was
     considering the first index to be 0 or 1. I have asked the instructor about this and I am awaiting a reply.
   
3. which problem(s) surprised you with a "gold-st-ring"? Which next state(s) did you not account for in the subset of next states? why?
   How to make sure you avoid such errors in your future flight/traffic/compiler state controller tasks, or in the near future, the course projects/exams?
  A: I did not encounter any problems with a "gold-st-ring", but if I have time before the assignment is due I will try other problems and see if I encounter one.

5. Other insights/comments/questions that you want the grader/instructor to know.
  A: I did not know what a "gold-st-ring" was, and I could not find the answer by searching.
     However, I did find some information on "gold states" which is likely the same thing.
